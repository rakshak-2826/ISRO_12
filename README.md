Methane Emission Detection System
Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and assessing methane emissions from garbage dumpsites using advanced image processing, geospatial analysis, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The system enhances the efficiency and accuracy of methane emission detection and provides a scalable, cost-effective method for environmental monitoring.

Key Components
Input Image Processing: Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to analyze input images of garbage dumpsites.
Geospatial Analysis: Integrates geospatial data to assess the environmental impact and spatial distribution of methane emissions.
Risk Prediction LLM Model: Employs a Large Language Model to predict risk levels associated with detected methane emissions.
Alert Mechanism: Automates the alert system to notify relevant authorities for timely intervention.
Impact
This solution addresses a critical environmental challenge by providing a scalable and automated method for monitoring methane emissions. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, it promotes safer and healthier communities through continuous surveillance and timely intervention.

Features
Automated Methane Detection: Detects methane emissions using image processing and geospatial analysis.
Risk Assessment: Predicts risk levels with an LLM model.
Real-Time Alerts: Sends automated alerts to authorities for prompt action.
